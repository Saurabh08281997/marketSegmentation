Use the below link to download the Data Set:[here](https://github.com/pik1989/MarketSegmentation/blob/main/Clustered_Customer_Data.csv) 
### Algorithms used :  
In this dataset i've used five clustering algorithm to perform segmentation.These algorithms are given below.
- [K-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
- [DBSCAN Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html)
### Final Model  :
We have created a Streamlit Application based on this clustering technique, where we are taking the customer details & identifying which cluster the custoemr belongs to.
